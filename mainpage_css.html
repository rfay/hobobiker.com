We stayed a police station last night. Evening came, and dark was nipping at our heels as we came to a intersection of two roads. The store and the gas station were the only thing around and they were both closed. The man with the little hot dog stand was closing up but had four hot dogs for sale which we gladly purchased and  greedly wolfed down.<br />
<br />
In the dark we noticed another building with a TV playing and a police car in front. We went to the door and knocked. We asked permission to camp there at the  police station, a very safe place to stay.<br />
<br />
Two of the policement asked if we needed anything.. I said yes -  I would like two cans of beer.  They went to the town many miles away  45 minutes later  drove back with their lights flashing. The beer had arrived.<br />
<br />
There are 5 guys who live at the station for a week to ten days, 24 hours a day. They make 100 dollars a month. Wow.<br />
<br />
In the morning the commander Armando, "el commandante", welcomed us with such openess this had to be the friendliest person I ever meet. He turned on the warm water to the shower in the concrete shower stall so we could have a "regadera".  We all talked and laughed in the morning. They let us use the kitchen and TV. One guy taught me Spanish and I taught him English. They  police used their trucks to drive the kid to school.. I wish I had picture of 15 kids sitting in the back of a police pickup truck, with one girl. The kids parked their bikes at the police station and went to school. As we rode away the Commandante, Armado, followed us in his car, turned his megaphone on and said "God Bless Randy and Nancy in Spanish.

It took us the better part of three days to ride south from Santa Ana to Hermosillo (arriving today). We camped two nights in fairly raw desert surroundings. Both nights we got to sundown without an established place to camp, so we stopped at a locked gate, unloaded our bikes, lifted everything over, and found a place to camp. Last night (shown in this picture) was a beautiful place among the cows and coyotes and cactus. <br />
<br />
Riding along the four-lane divided highway that is Highway 15 I was thinking about some of the things I like about Mexican drivers. Two things I like:<br />
<br />
1. The Mexican drivers do their absolute best to give us some space on the road. The truck drivers try to move over as soon as they see us (and there are two lanes in each direction, so it works most of the time). <br />
<br />
2. Mexican drivers know how to use their horns to communicate, not just to irritate. They have one honk to say "watch out" and another to say "go for it" and yet another to say "hey -what a beautiful woman!"<br />
<br />
(We're in Hermosillo tonight in a nice hotel, quite a contrast from the two previous nights in the desert.)

<p>We are in Magdelena de Kino. We rode 68 miles yesterday through - from
Patagonia through the border crossings to Imuris, Sonora, Mexico. What wonderful folks.
All sorts of people giving us waves and friendly beep and calling out from
the side of the road. The Nogales border crossing from Mexico to the
United States was had a line of semi trucks three deep and miles long waiting
to get into the USA. We got so many waves and beeps and whistle it was
almost embarrassing but I still kind of enjoyed the attention.</p>

<p>As evening approached we got looking for a place to camp for the evening a
guardian angle appeared. This American from Tucson stopped by the edge of
the road to say hi and ended up escorting us to his house 20 miles away.
He drove in back of us with his lights blinking and flashing. Our private
support vehicle. Bill is truly an angel.</p>
<p>
We got to his house and he told us his story. He buys food and clothes for
the people down here and gives it to them to either use, sell or give
away. He makes 3 trips a week from Tucson to Imuris or Guaymas full of
much needed goods. Some of goods goes to the Rancho which is like a
seminary and some goes to the local orphanage. The orphanage is not like
what we think of as a home for children with no parents. It is a place
that helps children with their needs. Perhaps they have parents that just
do not have enough resources to fully provide for the children the
orphanage helps out. He buys clothes, noodles and cereal in bulk from
Costco or air conditioners for the orphanage. All out of his own pocket.
He built the house in Imuris so he could have a place to store the goods
and then distribute them from there. I have not seen a person who has ever
given more of himself to other people then Bill from Tucson. He is an
extremely open and loving person who also has a blast doing this with his
life. I am sure Bill has a place in the big house when he leaves this
earth. </p></div>

Well, here we are again, on the road again. We arrived in Tucson on Thursday of last week and here we are on Tuesday still in Tucson but we are on the southern most part. We enjoyed a wonderful stay with Caroline and Mary in their beautiful home near Sombrero Point. The stay was useful as we got to get the last last kinks worked out of gears and backs. I had to go to the chiropractor to straighten out my back and to the dentist to check out the tooth from hell which  I had pulled three days before we left Denver. The visit was also wonderful to share their home and friendship. And we got to watch the Super Bowl. Go Bears!</p>
<p>We headed back on the road Monday morning and road through the West Saguaro National park on some good sandy remote roads. It is the strangest site to see multiple-armed  saguaro  cactus marching throughout the land. I always think of cartoons when I see a landscape of cactus. Of course we had to stop by the Desert Museum  for  the afternoon. Randy remembered the tortoises from when he was a kid and wanted to see them again. Unfortunately they are in hibernation so we did not get to see any. I loved seeing all the different large Cats and the Javalina which looks like a wild pig but is not. </p>
<p>During the ride this day I keep hearing a creak on the back of my bike drove me crazy. Neither one of us could figure out where it was coming from. We even changed wheels and it followed with the wheel. We decided to stay in town so we could go to a bike store the next day. It has been a long time since I slept in a baseball dugout but if you ever have a chance you might give it a try. The roof is covered, it is fenced in and is relatively safe. And there are bathrooms nearby. </p>
<p>Today we rode to <a href="http://ajobikes.com" rel="nofollow">Ajo bikes</a>, an extremely well-stocked store and employees who wonderfully helpful and patient. After hours of trying to figure out where the creaking sound was we discovered the rim had a radial crack a quarter way around on the braking sidewall. We had them build another wheel up and finally got out of there around 4:00. We rode for an hour and made it to the Crazy Horse RV Park and Campground.  We even got a warm shower. It seems funny but after only one night out in the park with no showers, the shower tonight made me feel like a queen and so appreciative of simple pleasures of warm clean water against my not so road-weary skin. Life is so good to us.</p>

</div></div>    <div class="content"><p>I don't think we expected the cold to follow us from Colorado, but we found out! The first day out from Phoenix was an easy day with an easy desert campsite. But the next day we got caught by the afternoon rain (and hid out in a motel). But the third day was all a gradual climb, with gradually increasing (cold) rain until we finally bailed into the desert beside the road as dusk approached. It was so cold and wet! We just huddled and tried to warm up and never did cook dinner. And in the morning I didn't ever get the courage to get up and fix the coffee like I do every morning. Nancy had to seize her role as Chief Courage Officer and get up and do all that. Finally we dragged out, and the final ride into Tucson wasn't really all that bad. But we sure hope it doesn't rain that much all the time!</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, I had *two* flats on the way from Oracle Junction into Tucson. That's the number of flats I had in the entire 4700 miles we rode from June to October. What's up with that?</p>
<p>We're enjoying a couple of fine rest days with great friends here in Tucson, and catching up on a little bit of work.</p>

</div></div>    <div class="content"><p>It's still the middle of a difficult winter in Denver (no bike riding for us in the last few months) but we flew yesterday to Phoenix, Arizona, to start our ride south. We're starting up again! </p>
<p>As you know, we finished up the first segment of the ride in San Diego/Tijuana in late October, and went home to get our affairs in order for the rest of the ride. We sold our house, sold our car, put everything we kept (not much) in storage, and are ready for a ride of at least two more years to Ushuaia, at the southern tip of South America.</p>
<p>We went for a test ride today and it's all strange - the bikes feel different and we feel out of shape. And of course we're threatened by what lies ahead, wondering if we're in good enough shape. As always, we'll try to take it a day at a time.</p>
<p>Our plan is to ride south through Tucson and Patagonia, Arizona, to Nogales, and then enter the Mexican state of Sonora, and head south from there. We hope to go up to Copper Canyon through a new route (coming in from the west) and then we'll down the Mexican heartland toward the Central Valley and Mexico City. </p>

</div></div>    <div class="content"><p>Well, we fly to Phoenix on Saturday the 27th to start our adventure anew! Our house sold (accidentally-we were going to rent it out), our stuff is packed. We have our rabies and Hepatitis B shots. Our finances are in order. We have a place to store our household goods. We're ready to head from Mexico to the bottom of South America!</p>
<p>The website is not updated for the next part of the trip, but I'll get to that eventually.</p>
<p>As I said, we sold our house accidentally. We decided to rent it out and hired a rental manager. They came and put up a sign, and a day or so later our neighbors 5 houses up the street came down and said "can we please, please, please buy your house?"  We said yes, and the deal has already closed.  Pretty amazing way to sell a house.</p>
<p>I've been selling stuff like crazy on Ebay, Craigslist, and Amazon. Almost all of my technical books are gone, along with old electronics, etc. Normally this stuff just eventually gets thrown away, so I'm pretty happy to be getting a little bike touring money off of it. A $50 sale is at least day of bike touring...</p>

Well, we're home trying to sort everything out after five months on the road. Our trip across the Western U.S. in a rental car took us to Bryce, Zion, and Arches National Parks, and mountain biking in Moab, Utah. I'm afraid we took way too many pictures and hope you'll indulge us in looking at them anyway. These places are among the most beautiful in the world. <br />
<br />

Our stove is the wonderful <a href="http://www.msrcorp.com/stoves/whisper_intl.asp">MSR Whisperlite Internationale</a>, which will burn many things besides the ordinary white gas. Most important, it burns regular unleaded gasoline, which we can get anywhere in exactly the right amount for a pittance. When we pull up to the gas pump, we pay from 25 to 75 cents to get about a 3-day supply. Our friends with white gas-based stoves sometimes have to buy a gallon of white gas for $7.00 or more and then give away (or waste) most of it. <br />
<br />
Nancy's loves to pull into a gas station with our bikes and set up to fill the cannister. Sometimes she'll claim that I have a motor on my bike and that's what the gas is for. Other times the station will have a "free donut with fillup" or some such deal. She'll ask if we can have the free donut.
